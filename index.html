    <center> <h2>Hi! Here are some things you should know about me.</h2> </center>
   
    <center> <p> I love corgis and pandas. I would love to buy a corgi someday. Buying a panda might be an issue though... I spend most of my free time doing nothing. I enjoy rainy days, but only when I am inside or in a car. Going to school in the rain is not a fun expereince. My favorite color is purple. My room used to be purple, but I repainted it since it was making my room too dark.  The first concert I ever went to was BlackPink's Born Pink Concert last November. It was a crazy day.   </p> </center>
